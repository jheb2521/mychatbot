Causes of stress
Losing a family member, divorce, and moving are all major life changes that can cause stress. Some studiesTrusted Source link an overactive stress system and high levels of cortisol in the body to depression and other health conditions, including heart disease. When the mind feels threatened, the body produces more stress hormones — such as cortisol — to help the body fight or run away from the threat. This works well if you’re in real danger, but it doesn’t always benefit you in your daily life.

Other examples of events that can cause stress include:

getting into a fight with your spouse or significant other
losing your job
major natural disasters, such as earthquakes or tornadoes, that can damage your home or destroy it altogether
getting into a car accident, which can cause physical, emotional, and financial stress
being robbed, mugged, or attacked
Certain lifestyle choices can also contribute to your stress levels. This is especially true if they affect your overall health or if you become dependent on unhealthy coping mechanisms. Lifestyle choices that can increase your stress include:

heavy or excessive consumption of alcohol
not getting enough exercise
smoking or using illegal drugs
working for long periods of time without taking a break, or being a “workaholic”
not eating a well-balanced diet
spending too much time watching television or playing video games
looking at a smartphone in bed, which can keep you from falling asleep
Sometimes the constant stresses of daily life trigger your fight-or-flight response. This can lead to complications, including depression. In other cases, the development of depression is unrelated to stress.

Depression can make experiencing and coping with events in your life more challenging. Big and small stresses still occur, but with depression, you may not feel as equipped to deal with them. This can make the symptoms of depression and the stress of certain situations even worse.Types of stress
Stress can be caused by a single event or by temporary situations. This is known as acute stress. Acute stress can be brought on by events that stress you out, such as taking a big test, or by an acute injury, such as a broken bone.

Stress can also last a long time without ever feeling like it’s easing up. In these instances, events or illnesses may cause continuous stress or there may be no clear reason for your stress. This is known as chronic stress. Chronic stress is usually the result of personal, lifestyle, or health issues that are also chronic. Common causes of chronic stress include:

having financial struggles
working at a high-pressure job
having personal or relationship issues at home
not feeling like you have enough support from family or friends Effects of stress on depression
While stress can generally have negative effects on your physical and mental health, it can be especially harmful if you have depression.

Stress can make you feel less able to maintain positive habits or coping strategies, which are important to managing depression. This can make symptoms of depression feel more intense. Interrupting a healthy routine can result in negative coping strategies, such as drinking or withdrawing from social relationships. These actions can result in further stress, which can then make depression symptoms worse.

Stress can also affect your mood, as anxiety and irritability are both common responses to stress. When a stressor causes you to feel anxious, the anxiety may result in more negative feelings or frustration, even if the stressor is only temporary.Tips on managing stress
Stress management techniques are useful in coping with depression. Stress relief can also help prevent depressive symptoms from developing. Some helpful stress management techniques include:

getting enough sleep
eating a healthy diet
getting regular exercise
taking occasional vacations or regular breaks from work
finding a relaxing hobby, such as gardening or woodworking
consuming less caffeine or alcohol
doing breathing exercises to lower your heart rate
If lifestyle choices are causing you stress, you may consider changing the way you approach your personal or professional life. Some ways you can help decrease this kind of stress include:

putting yourself under less pressure to perform at work or school, such as by lowering your standards to a level you still find acceptable
not taking on as many responsibilities at work or activities at home
sharing responsibilities or delegating tasks to others around you
surrounding yourself with supportive and positive friends and family members
removing yourself from stressful environments or situations
Activities such as yoga, meditation, or attending religious services can also help you deal with stress. A combination of these techniques may prove even more effective. It’s important to find what works for you. And no matter what you choose, it’s vital to have close friends and family members who are willing to support you.

Talking to a counselor, therapist, or other mental health professional can also be a useful way to deal with stress and depression. Talk therapy alone or combined with cognitive behavioraltherapy (CBT) or medication is a proven solution for both depression and chronic stress. Medications for depression include:

selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as citalopram (Celexa)
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as isocarboxazid (Marplan) What the expert says
“A depressed person is compromised in dealing with problematic situations,” says Stacey Stickley, a licensed professional counselor practicing in Ashburn, Virginia. “When a person is dealing with depression, things may seem more negative than they really are. Events that would have been taken in stride may seem more problematic or impossible to handle. The idea of taking action on things may require more of a person’s resources, resources that are already compromised due to the depression.”

“Talk to your doctor about pharmacological options, or go talk to a counselor about evaluating and managing your symptoms,” she says. “Don’t wait. Being proactive is important so you can maybe stop the downward slide sooner. It’s easier to climb out of a shallow hole than one you have been slowly digging and tunneling into for several months.”
1. Mindfulness Meditation
How it works: Mindfulness meditation teaches you to focus on the present moment, which reduces overthinking and calms the mind.
How to practice:
Find a quiet space where you won't be disturbed.
Sit comfortably with your back straight and your hands resting in your lap.
Close your eyes and focus on your breath. Breathe in deeply and breathe out slowly.
If your mind starts to wander (which it will!), simply notice it and gently return your attention to your breath.
You can start with 5-10 minutes and gradually increase the duration over time.
Tip: Apps like Headspace or Insight Timer offer guided meditations, which can be helpful when starting out.
2. Exercise (Physical Activity)
How it works: Exercise boosts your mood by releasing endorphins and helps manage stress by reducing cortisol levels. It also improves sleep and overall health.
How to practice:
Choose an activity you enjoy: If you don’t like running, try swimming, cycling, or a dance class.
Start with 30 minutes of moderate activity (like walking, yoga, or aerobics) 3-5 times a week.
You don’t need a gym! A quick walk around the block or a home workout (like bodyweight exercises) is just as effective.
Tip: Combine exercise with mindfulness by going for a walk in nature and focusing on your surroundings—this combines movement and stress relief.
3. Deep Breathing and Breathing Techniques
How it works: Deep breathing triggers the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest), which calms the body and mind.
How to practice:
Box Breathing: Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds. Repeat for 2-5 minutes.
4-7-8 Breathing: Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8. This is great for calming the mind before sleep.
Tip: Practice these techniques throughout the day or when you’re feeling anxious to quickly lower stress levels.
4. Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)
How it works: Tensing and releasing muscle groups helps release physical tension and promotes relaxation.
How to practice:
Start from your feet and work up to your head.
Feet: Tense the muscles in your feet for 5 seconds, then release for 20 seconds.
Calves, thighs, abdomen, etc.: Continue tensing and releasing each muscle group.
Tip: Focus on the difference between tension and relaxation to really notice how much stress is released.
5. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Techniques
How it works: CBT helps you identify negative thought patterns and replace them with more balanced, realistic thoughts.
How to practice:
Step 1: Identify negative thoughts or beliefs. For example, "I can never get everything done."
Step 2: Challenge the thought. "What evidence do I have for this? Have I successfully completed tasks before?"
Step 3: Replace it with a more balanced thought: "I have a lot on my plate, but I can prioritize and get things done."
Tip: Keep a journal to track these thoughts and practice replacing them daily.
6. Nature and Outdoor Activities
How it works: Being outdoors reduces stress by helping you disconnect from technology and immerse yourself in a natural, calming environment.
How to practice:
Walk in a park, forest, or beach for at least 15-30 minutes. Pay attention to your surroundings—the sound of birds, the feel of the breeze, or the scent of fresh air.
Try forest bathing (Shinrin Yoku), a Japanese practice of mindful walking in the forest to boost well-being.
Tip: If you’re unable to go outdoors, try looking at nature videos or images—they can also lower stress.
7. Social Support and Talking It Out
How it works: Sharing your thoughts with someone you trust helps you feel understood and supported, which can reduce feelings of isolation and stress.
How to practice:
Schedule regular check-ins with friends, family, or even colleagues. A 10-minute phone call can make a difference.
Express your feelings: Be honest about what’s stressing you out. Sometimes just saying it out loud can relieve a lot of tension.
Tip: If you don’t have someone to talk to, consider journaling or seeking out a therapist for professional support.
8. Aromatherapy (Essential Oils)
How it works: Certain essential oils, like lavender or eucalyptus, have calming effects that reduce stress and anxiety.
How to practice:
Use a diffuser: Add a few drops of your chosen oil to a diffuser and let the scent fill the room.
Inhale directly: Put a drop on your hands and inhale deeply. You can also apply diluted oils to your pulse points (wrists, neck).
Tip: Lavender is known for relaxation, while peppermint can help with focus. Experiment with different oils to see which works best for you.
9. Journaling or Expressive Writing
How it works: Writing helps you process emotions and reduces the mental clutter that often comes with stress.
How to practice:
Set aside 10-15 minutes each day to free-write. Don’t worry about grammar or structure—just let your thoughts flow onto the paper.
Prompts: “What’s on my mind today?” or “What is causing me stress right now, and how can I cope with it?”
Tip: Write first thing in the morning to clear your mind or at night to unwind.
10. Sleep Hygiene
How it works: Good sleep is essential for managing stress. Poor sleep contributes to irritability and makes it harder to cope with daily challenges.
How to practice:
Create a bedtime routine: Wind down an hour before bed. Avoid screens, caffeine, or heavy meals.
Set a consistent sleep schedule: Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, even on weekends.
Tip: Make your bedroom a sleep-friendly environment: keep it dark, quiet, and cool.
11. Time Management
How it works: Proper time management helps reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed and helps you focus on important tasks.
How to practice:
Use the Pomodoro Technique: Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After four cycles, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).
Prioritize tasks: Make a to-do list and tackle high-priority items first.
Tip: Delegate tasks when possible, and don’t be afraid to say no if your plate is already full.
12. Creative Expression
How it works: Creative activities like painting, writing, or music allow you to express emotions, take your mind off stress, and improve mental clarity.
How to practice:
Start simple: Grab a sketchbook, write a poem, or play an instrument. Don’t worry about the outcome—focus on the process.
Engage in art or music regularly, whether it's painting, dancing, or playing an instrument.
Tip: Art therapy is especially useful for processing difficult emotions. If you’re feeling stuck, try abstract art—there’s no “right” or “wrong” way.
13. Nutrition and Hydration
How it works: A balanced diet and proper hydration help regulate stress hormones and improve overall mood and energy.
How to practice:
Eat balanced meals: Include complex carbs (whole grains), protein, and healthy fats (avocados, nuts, olive oil). Avoid processed sugars and excessive caffeine, which can spike stress.
Stay hydrated: Aim for at least 8 glasses of water per day. Herbal teas like chamomile or peppermint can also promote relaxation.
Tip: Magnesium-rich foods (like spinach, almonds, and bananas) are especially good for relaxing muscles and reducing stress
